Greetings, and welcome to my game.

This is a 3-stage platformer drawing off of the three stages of life:
incarnate, confront, and commandeer.
You play as the character Ned, a golden boy whos essence is otherwordly.
Below is an in depth description of each level as it pertains to the stages of growth.

INCARNATE
The player is dropped into a world which he has little control over. Here we get introduced to the pirate theme while bouncing around by the whims of your surroundings

CONFRONT
The player now gains a higher perspective. Instead of being a cannonball, he navigates on top of them. Through this the world is starting to be known. Note the increase in personal control

COMMANDEER
The player reaches the final stage where he interacts with the environment and co-creates it. This stage is reminiscent of the ship of theseus thought experiment; Ned now takes part in adddessing his inner being and can stand at the helm of his ship with a straight spine and the sea breeze tossing his hair.

I added extra parameters to the game listed below. Further down is a list of all the assets that I used coupled with their links.
