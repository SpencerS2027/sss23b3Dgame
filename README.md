Greetings, and welcome to my game.

This is a 3-stage platformer inspired by three stages of life: incarnate, confront, and commandeer.
You play as the character Ned, a golden boy whose essence is beyond that of the game.
Below is an in-depth description of each level as it pertains to the stages of growth.

INCARNATE
The player is dropped into a world which he has little control over. Here we get introduced to the pirate theme, bouncing through the scene according to the whims of your surroundings

CONFRONT
The player now gains a higher perspective. Instead of acting as a cannonball, he navigates on top of them. Through this persepctive the world is starting to be known. Here we see the first instance of greater control.

COMMANDEER
The player reaches the final stage where he interacts with the environment and co-creates it. This stage is reminiscent of the ship of theseus thought experiment; Ned now takes part in addressing his inner being and can stand at the helm of his ship with a straight spine and the sea breeze of life tossing his hair.

I added extra parameters to the game listed below. Further down is a list of all the assets that I used coupled with their links.
